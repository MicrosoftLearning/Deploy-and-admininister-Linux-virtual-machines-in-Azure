3. Use the **datasource type** drop-down to review the many different resources the Backup Center can protect.
4. Point out the default backup policy and that a custom backup policy can be created.
5. Discuss how a single backup policy can be used across many different virtual machines.
6. Review the backup policy configuration settings (schedule and retention).
7. Review how to monitor backup jobs.
