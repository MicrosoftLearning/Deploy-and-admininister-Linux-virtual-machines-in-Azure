## Discussion points

1. Enable VM Insights. Review how to use a data collection rule and how to select a Log Analytics workspace. The data collection rule and Log Analytics workspace will be provided to credential candidates. Installing agents is not covered in the credential.
2. Create an alert based on metrics. For example, create a new alert rule based on CPU percentage usage.
3. Discuss the use of action groups and how to assign an action group to the alert. This is not part of the credential.
4. Review how to monitor an alert when it is triggered.
